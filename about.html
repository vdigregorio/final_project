She creates personalized meal plans and teaches dynamic cooking classes that focus on helping clients become more independent in the kitchen and ultimately lead healthier lives.
						I am a NYC-based Functional Culinary Nutritionist currently gaining experience in the field of Culinary Genomics - the union between nutrition science, genomic medicine and the culinary arts. Food is more than just fuel for our bodies, it is our most basic medicine and it has the power to transform our physical and mental health. My core philosophy centers around a holistic, personalized approach to health- no one diet is fit for all- and one that digs deep to uncover root causes of imbalances.
